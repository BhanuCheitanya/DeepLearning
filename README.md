Abstract : This project takes the input data in the format of ECG (ElectroCardioGraph) readings and then processes it using the LSTM(Sequential Model, epoch = 10, accuracy >= 99.50) for deriving the arrhythmic response of the heart and then predicting the type of abnormality.  This Project uses only LSTM model and some basic concepts of Deep Learning.  The runtime of this particular model is high so if using a GPU with memory higher than 6 gigs, remember changing the usage to GPU from CPU (default).Only do this if the system GPU is powerful enough.
